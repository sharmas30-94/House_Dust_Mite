Extracts Dermatophagoides farinae (DF)–matching read segments (CIGAR M stretches ≥50 bp, MAPQ ≥30) from paired-end and singleton FASTQs (typically derived from unmapped reads of CRAM files).
Reads are aligned with bwa-mem2 to the DF reference; mapped reads are filtered and converted to FASTA for downstream BLAST or other analyses.
